# APO_modelling

Scripts for modelling atmospheric potential oxygen (APO) at UK sites, using inventory emissions estimates and the NAME atmospheric model.

We investigate the model sensitivities to its components: the biospheric and fossil fuel oxidative ratios, the fossil fuel fluxes, and the ocean fluxes.
