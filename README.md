# APO_modelling

Scripts for modelling atmospheric potential oxygen (APO) at UK sites, using inventory emissions estimates and the NAME atmospheric model.

We investigate the model sensitivities to its components: the biospheric and fossil fuel oxidative ratios, the fossil fuel fluxes, and the ocean fluxes.

## Making the figures

## Estimating the APO forward model

The forward model is run using several scripts:

- Timeseries/Timeseries_split.py\
    Runs the forward model for each APO component.
    Run using RunCodes/Timeseries/run_split_timeseries.sh.

    In the bash script we specify the:
    - year(s);
    - site(s);
    - sector: either bio, ff, or ocean;
    - climatology: true or false;
    - oxidative ratio source;
    - ff model: edgar or edgar-ukghg;
    - month: either all (runs each month separately before joining to reduce memory use), a single month, or year (runs whole year in one go).

    This outputs a netcdf file containing the forward model for each species required within the sector specified:
    - bio: o2 & co2     (not needed for APO but run to model CO2 and O2 separately)
    - ff: o2 & co2
    - ocean: co2, o2, n2    (co2 & o2 are calculated for all ocean models)

- Timeseries/Timeseries_join_months.py\
    Joins the forward models for each month produced above into a model for the whole year.
    This is automatically run when running RunCodes/Timeseries/run_split_timeseries.sh.

- Timeseries/Timeseries_join_months.ipynb\
    As above but to be run as needed.

- Timeseries/Timeseries_sectors.py\
    Runs the forward model for each ff sector separately.

- Timeseries/Timeseries_sectors_join.ipynb\
    Joins the above into one netcdf file with variables for each sector.

- Timeseries/Timeseries_bc.py\
    Runs the forward model for the boundary conditions.
    Run using RunCodes/Timeseries/run_bc_timeseries.sh.

    In the bash script we specify the:
    - year;
    - site(s);
    - climatology: true or false;
    - month: either all (runs each month separately before joining to reduce memory use), a single month, or year (runs whole year in one go).
    
    This outputs a netcdf file containing the baseline for:
    - delta APO
    - CO2
    - O2
    - delta O2/N2'

- Timeseries/JC_baseline_adjust.ipynb\
    Calculates an adjustment to the Jena Carboscope (JC) baseline:
    - compares the no-ocean APO model with the osb for each month;
    - subtracts the difference from the JC baseline;
    - saves the adjusted baseline to the bc timeseries netcdf file.

    Plots both fields and the difference between them,
    Plots the APO model from each field & obs, as well as the ff uncertainty from the Monte Carlo (see below)

    - Gets a total ffO2,
    - Finds the standard deviation etc,
    - Converts to uncertainty in APO,
